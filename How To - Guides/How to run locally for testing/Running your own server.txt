------------------- How to Run Locally -------------------
----------------------------------------------------------

First step is to download/clone the TG Station Repo, or your fork of it.
Clone the repository to a folder named "tgstation".
Open the folder you've cloned the repository to, and run the "BUILD.cmd" file. This will build the application for running - and will also update the server if you've made any changes.
Then run the "tgstation.dmb" file to actually open the game.

Once the game has opened, look at the right-hand side of the screen.
You'll see a bunch of options like "changelog, rules, wiki, forum", etc.

Under those rules will be another ribbon of options, reading "status, mc, admin, Debug, ic, mapping", etc.
On that same ribbon, look for the "Server" option and click that.

Once the Server tab is open, click the "Start Now" option that appears. 
Then, on the left-hand side of the screen (the game window), hit "Not Ready".
This should change the button to say "Ready" - and lets you ready-up for the game.
Once the server is done loading, you will automatically spawn into the game.


Note:
-----
Some people don't have trouble with auto-updates from changes they've made, and can just run the "tgstation.dmb" file to run the game,
But I've found that I continuously need to run "BUILD.cmd" whenever I've made changes, for them to take effect in the game.
If you notice that your changes aren't showing in-game, run the "BUILD.cmd" file to "update the server", then run the game with the "tgstation.dmb" file.
