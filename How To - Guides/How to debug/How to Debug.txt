------------------- How to Debug -------------------
----------------------------------------------------
Once you've opened and hosted the game locally,
You should immediately spawn into the game.

Once the game has opened, look at the right-hand side of the screen.
You'll see a bunch of options like "changelog, rules, wiki, forum", etc.

Under those rules will be another ribbon of options, reading "status, mc, admin, Debug, ic, mapping", etc.
On that same ribbon, look for the "Debug" option and click that.

Once you've hit that, you should see a variety of options at your disposal.

There are a lot of options to cover, so I wont be covering all of them,
but in most cases, where you need to type a name of something (usually to spawn an item or entity), make sure that the name is exactly the same.
