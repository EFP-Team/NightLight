------------------- How to add clothes-------------------
---------------------------------------------------------

Before we get into it, let's quickly cover the structure of a clothing item.
Clothing items consist of 2x parts.
1) The icon (which shows in your hand or respective-clothing button on the GUI when held or equipped)
2) The actual item itself (as it shows on your character, ingame. This is the item that your character wears, and everyone else can see)

Because of this, we need to create 2x "icons" (Basically just images).
One will be for the actual Icon itself, the other for the clothing itself.
BOTH of these need to have the same names! This is super important!

Another quick note, in DreamMaker, you might have the same issue as I do with the ".dmi" files, 
Where I can't see the "state name" of the items. I'm not too sure how to fix this, but I do have an easy workaround.
Simply hover over the item (near the bottom of it) until your mouse cursor turns from the regular arrow into an "I" shaped cursor, then double-click.
You can also click on an item, then hit F2, and this should show the name as well.

The Icons:

Adding the Icon to the game
---------------------------
For my example, I'll just be adding a new jacket (called spacewar_parka_green - or "Space War Parka (green)", ingame)

I start off by heading over to the following directory/folder:
	SS13\code\modules\clothing\suits
And I open up the "jacket.dm" file -> this should open in the DreamMaker app.

Once I've got that open in DreamMaker, I can see a window that has some code on it.
A quick inspection tells me that each of these blocks of code are for a few different types of jackets.

I copy and paste the entire codeblock for the Bomber jacket (What I've chosen as a template) - from the line starting like this:
	/obj/item/clothing/suit/jacket/bomber
to the final closing bracket ")" of that codeblock.

I then change it up to how I want -> renaming it, since this will be my new jacket, the Space War Parka (green).

I leave most things the same, changing basically only the name, icon_state and description.
Note: The name is the final part of the line that reads /obj/item/clothing/suit/jacket/bomber, so in this case, the name is "bomber"


Changing how the Icon looks:
----------------------------
Once we've added the Icon, we now need to define what it looks like ingame, when someone wears it.

We first head over to the following directory/folder:
	SS13\icons\obj\clothing\suits
And we open the "jacket.dmi" file.

Once that's open in DreamMaker, we're greeted with a whole bunch of jacket icons.

Simply double-click on the earliest empty space, to add a new one.
Add your jacket Icon to the space, by designing it with the tools given, then exit out with the "back" option in the bottom-right of the window.

Note: You can do the same thing here to change how an existing icon looks by simply double-clicking on the one you want to change, then just edit it and Save).

----------------------------
The Actual Items Themselves:
----------------------------
We head over to the following directory/folder:
	SS13\icons\mob\clothing\suits
And we open the "jacket.dmi" file.

This will look almost identical to the file we worked with earlier, but it differs in that this file will contain side and back profiles of the clothing.
This file contains the actual clothing worn by the player when it's equipped. 
You can see these rotation profiles by double-clicking on any of the items in the list. You should see the rotation options just below the editor window.


OK, here comes the tricky part..
Right-click any of the existing items you'd like to use as a template, then hit Export. Save it to the same folder, but change the name (so as to not overwrite the existing files!). 
I'm naming mine "spacewar_parka_green.dmi"

Once saved, open that file in a new DreamMaker window, change up the jacket to look how you want,
Then back in our DreamMaker editor - on the same window you Exported from - hit Import and select the file we created/edited/changed.

When you import this item into the DreamMaker editor, you'll probably suddenly see some names pop up - this is your chance to rename your item. I renamed my "state name" to "spacewar_parka_green".
Once the item has been reimported into "jacket.dmi" and saved, we need to delete the file we created when we exported (this is just to clean up the folder)
In my case, I'll be deleting "spacewar_parka_green.dmi" in the folder.

Now, we need to go back to our Icons file from before, and check that the Icon code we created, matches what we just added to the game!
In my case, I'll be heading back to "jacket.dm" in the following folder:
	SS13\code\modules\clothing\suits

Icon state here, specifically, needs to match the state name we just saved our icon as (in my case, "m65_spacewar_parka_green")
